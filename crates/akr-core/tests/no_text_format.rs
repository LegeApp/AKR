//! Exit criterion 4: the crate compiles with no parser and no text-format dependency.
//!
//! P1 is semantics-first by design (`docs/13` §1): a parser written first tends to
//! define the model by accident. This test makes that a property of the build rather
//! than a promise in a document — if someone adds a runtime dependency to reach for a
//! serialisation library, it fails here.

/// The dependency list, kept to exactly what `docs/13` §4 sanctions.
///
/// One entry, added by P7. Stage E materialises the resolved model into a SQLite cache
/// with an FTS5 index, and neither a SQL engine nor a BM25 ranker is a reasonable thing to
/// own — which is why §4 named SQLite in the short list of permitted dependencies while
/// the SHA-256, JSON, glob and argument-parsing entries beside it were all written in
/// house instead.
///
/// The allowance is a list rather than a hole: a second entry fails this test, and the
/// conversation about whether it belongs happens here rather than in review.
