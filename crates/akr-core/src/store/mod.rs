//! Stage E — the index cache (`docs/06-compiler-pipeline.md` §7).
//!
//! A materialisation of the resolved model into `.akr/cache/index.sqlite`, whose DDL is
//! [`spec/schema/index.sql`](../../../../spec/schema/index.sql) — included here verbatim
//! rather than retyped, so the schema the tool creates and the schema the spec describes
//! cannot drift apart.
//!
//! # What this is not (D-019)
//!
//! A cache. Never authoritative, never committed, always rebuildable, and read by nothing
//! outside this crate. Deleting it costs one rebuild. That boundary is what keeps the
//! schema free to change, and it is the reason this module exposes a *builder* and a
//! *query*, never a connection: a caller that could reach the connection could reach the
//! schema, and the schema would then have compatibility obligations the design has not
//! promised.
//!
//! # Invalidation is silent
//!
//! §7 step 2: a `meta` row that disagrees with the tool's values means drop everything and
//! rebuild. That is routine, not a diagnostic. The `AKR-I` codes here mean the cache could
//! not be built — never that it had to be.
