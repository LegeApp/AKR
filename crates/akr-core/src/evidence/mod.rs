//! Recording what was observed, and attaching it to an acceptance check.
//!
//! The library operation behind `akr evidence add` (`docs/07-cli.md`) and behind the
//! `--check` argument of `akr complete`.
//!
//! # The write pipeline
//!
//! Every write in AKR goes parse → apply → **validate the resulting ledger** → canonically
//! format → write, and fails completely rather than partially (`docs/07-cli.md` §4). This
//! module implements the middle three: it applies a change to a cloned ledger, validates
//! the *result*, and hands back either the new records or the diagnostics that stopped
//! them. Nothing here touches the filesystem — serialising and writing is the caller's,
//! which keeps the atomicity guarantee in one place.
//!
//! # Evidence never declares what it verifies
//!
//! [`AddEvidence`] has no field for "what this proves", and that absence is the point
//! (D-016). The `verified_by` link is authored on the **check**, and [`attach`] is the
//! only way to create it. A two-directional link would be two sources of truth and a
//! reconciliation rule nobody wants to write.
