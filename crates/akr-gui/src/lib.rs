//! Read-only, native review workbench for AKR workspaces.
//!
//! `akr-gui` deliberately owns no ledger parser.  The `WorkspaceLoader` seam
//! accepts the immutable projection supplied by `akr-cli`, which makes the
//! desktop process a presentation client rather than a second authority.

#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
#![allow(missing_docs)] // The adapter is intentionally public while its CLI API settles.
